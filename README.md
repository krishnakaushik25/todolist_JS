# BUILD To-Do-List APP Using JavaScript

This project is  to create a beautiful and functional to do list using JavaScript.


When you open the folder, you'll find all the files needed to get started, the CSS code,(see style.css file), and the logic behind buidling this app is written step by step in  HTML and JavaScript files.

the to-do list created has a beautiful UI, the user can add a to-do by filling the input and hit ENTER, after that he can rather check the to-do when it's done, or remove it using the delete button.

The user's to-do list is stored in the local storage, so when he refreshes the page, he can always find the list there.

There is the possibility for the user, to clear the list, by clicking the button clear, at the top right corner of our app.

The to do list app, shows the today's date to the user, for that we're using a method called toLocaleDateString, which you can read about here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleDateString
